I am a graduate student in the `Applied Urban Science and Informatics` program at `New York University`. Before joining NYU, I received my bachelor’s degree in `Japanese Literature` with a minor in `Applied Psychology` from `Nankai University`.

My current work lies at the intersection of `digital civics`, `human–computer–environment interaction`, and `urban simulations`. I study how residents make sense of complex urban changes when information is uneven, and how interactive systems can make civic data more interpretable and negotiable. At NYU, I work on projects that connect `environmental simulations`—such as shadow, transportation, and air-quality models—to community narratives in Manhattan Chinatown. I also conduct `VR-based perceptual experiments` using 360° video, EEG, and EDA measurements to examine how urban greenery shapes stress responses across different contexts.

Previously, I have gained experience in industry through roles at `Ford`, `Lenovo`, and `IKEA`, working on user-facing interfaces, internal communication, and data-driven operational tools. These applied experiences inform how I design technologies that must function across real organizational, cultural, and community settings.

Outside of work, I like bouldering, swimming, and spending too much time in the kitchen. If you meet me in person, there is a good chance I’ll try to cook you something unnecessarily complicated from Chinese home cooking.
